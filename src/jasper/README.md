Before installing any package it is recommended that you update the packages and repository using the following command.

```sh
yum -y update
```

1. [Install Java](installJava.md)

## Install JAVA

Install the Java Development Kit with the following command:

```sh
sudo yum install java-11-openjdk-devel
```

Install OpenJRE 11

Java Runtime Environment 11 (Open JRE 11) is a subset of OpenJDK. Therefore, both packages are included in the command:

```sh
sudo yum install java-11-openjdk
```

 The official Oracle JDK is not available for download from the local repository. You have to download the .rpm package from the [Java SE Downloads page](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html).

After the download is complete, you can install the package with the command:

```sh
sudo yum localinstall jre-VERSION-linux-x64.rpm
```

### Verify Java is Installed on Your System

The following command shows which Java release you have and confirms installation was successful:

```sh
java â€“version
```

### Install Specific Version of Java

You can also install any of the other versions of Java by changing the version number in the command.

### Install JDK 8

- You may decide to use Open JDK 8, instead of the default OpenJDK 11.
- To do so, type in the following command in the terminal:

```sh
sudo yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk-devel
```

### Install JRE 8

As a subset of Open JDK 8, you can install Open JRE 8 by typing in the command:

```sh
sudo yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk
```

### Install Oracle Java 12

- As previously mentioned, you have to download Oracle Java from its official page.
- To install the newest version, simply download the appropriate package from their [webpage](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) and continue with the installation.


## How to Set Default Java Version

- Since you can have multiple versions of Java installed on your system, you can decide which one is the default one. To do so;
- Run a command that shows all the installed versions on your computer:

```sh
sudo alternatives --config java
```

- The image above shows that there are two alternatives to this system. These choices are represented by numbers **1** (Java 11) and **2** (Java 8).
- To change the default version, type the associated number (in this case, 1 or 2) and press **Enter**.

### How to Set JAVA_HOME Environment Variable

1. First, locate where Java is installed:

```sh
sudo update-alternatives --config java
```

![img2](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/set-java-home-environment.png)

In the output, you can find the path for each Java package installed on the system.

- **/usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-11.0.3.7-0.el7_6.x86_64/bin/java** (where **OpenJDK 11** is located)
- **/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.8.0-openjdk-1.8.0.212.b04-0.el7_6.x86_64/jre/bin/java** (where **OpenJDK 8** is located)

2. Once you see all the paths, copy the one of your preferred Java version.
3. Then, open the .bash_profile with any text editor. In this example, we use vim:

```sh
nano .bash_profile
```

4. At the bottom of the file, add a line which specifies the location of `JAVA_HOME` and `JAVA_JRE` in the following manner:

You will get the following output.

```sh
export JAVA_HOME="/your/installation/path/"
export JRE_HOME="/your/installation/path/jre"
```

For example, if we copy the installation path for Java 11 in the previous step, the added line in the text editor will be:

```sh
/usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-11.0.3.7-0.el7_6.x86_64/bin/java
```

Now source the file using the following command.

```sh
source ~/.bash_profile
```

Now you can run the echo `$JAVA_HOME` command again to check if the environment variable is set or not.
