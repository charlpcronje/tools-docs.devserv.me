sudo yum install rstudio-server-rhel-2021.09.2-382-x86_64.rpm
```

## Accessing RStudio Server

By default RStudio Server runs on port 8787 and accepts connections from all remote clients. After installation you should therefore be able to navigate a web browser to the following address to access the server:

[http://<server-ip>:8787](http://<server-ip>:8787)
RStudio will prompt for a username and password, and will authenticate the user by checking the server's username and password database.

A couple of notes related to user authentication:

- RStudio Server will not permit logins by system users (those with user ids lower than 100).
- User credentials are encrypted using RSA as they travel over the network.
- You can manage users with standard Linux user administration tools like useradd, userdel, etc.
- Each user needs to be created with a home directory.

    If you are unable to access the server after installation, you should run the verify-installation command to output additional diagnostics:

```shell
sudo rstudio-server verify-installation
```
